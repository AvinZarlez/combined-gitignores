# Combined gitignores

This repo contains some commonly combined gitignore files from github for use with Unity or CoronaSDK on Windows using Visual Studio and/or Visual Studio Code.

To use them, rename the file you'd like to .gitignore and include in the root of your git repo.

# Bonus: Visual Studio Code .settings for Unity

Also included in the Unity folder is a .setting folder to ignore .git, .dll, and .meta files from Visual Studio Code's search.

By placing the folder in the root of a Visual Studio Code workspace, it will automatically override your default "search.excludeFolders" settings.
